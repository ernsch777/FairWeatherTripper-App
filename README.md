1. I've already did a lot of revisions of this code online, but here is my first commit for my new app "Fair Weather Tripper".  It will pull in weather and map data from two separate APIs online and generate the weather for your upcoming trip. This would allow the user to plan/prepare for the weather during each step of their trip no matter if they are in the mountains, low elevation, or different weather zones all together.
2. I have the weather API pulling in accurate weather for one stop at a time, I've updated how I want the weather data cards to display, and set up the overall HTML layout for the site. I've also started on handling the weather API error messages and a "loading" indicator since the weather API can be delayed by a second or two depending on internet connection.
3. Next steps are to fix the error message, working on a loading indicator/screen, and adding the multi-stop buttons and input fields.
4. Added title and adjusted html page layout and fonts.
5. Finally nailed down error handling on the search terms entered. Added media queries and responseive layout for title and search/map main sections. 
6. Fine tuned error handling and working on loading screen and spacing.
7. Added thrown error when necessary and added Async/Await code to replace straight forward fetch syntax.
8.
